# Simplified DES

SDES was designed by Professor Edward Schaefer to help students understand modern cryptographic techniques. Thus we can say, it was developed for educational purposes only. Evidently, its algorithm is very semilar to DES, but he removed the complexities that students can do the procedure on the paper.
