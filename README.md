# Simplified DES

SDES was designed by Professor Edward Schaefer to help students understand modern cryptographic techniques. Thus we can say, it was developed for educational purposes only. Evidently, its algorithm is very semilar to DES, but it was made easier to understand that students can do the procedure on paper.
